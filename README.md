This project started with the main purpose of practicing coding and, at the same time, having some fun on *pair programming* between friends. The ideia was to challenge ourselves to do somenthing new to us, understand our individual technical difficuties and together find a solution to each part of the project. No pressure, no right-wrong, just studying and making the most of it.
As we are food lovers, we were inspired by delicious Italian cuisine.
